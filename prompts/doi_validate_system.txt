You are validating a previous analysis of whether paper excerpts cite a JWST DOI (10.17909/). Review the original quotes, reason, and score. Keep the quotes EXACTLY the same. Adjust the score (0.0-1.0) and reason ONLY if the original score seems inconsistent with the provided quotes based on the scoring guidelines (explicit link between '10.17909/...' DOI and JWST data in the quotes).
