Analyze the following excerpts from an astronomy paper to determine the likelihood it presents new science results using data from the {mission} mission. DO NOT COUNT citations to other papers or prior works. Only consider if the snippets support that this current paper is a {mission} science paper.

**Task:**
Determine whether *this paper* is a {mission} science paper. Return a JSON object adhering to the specified format. The 'quotes' MUST be exact substrings copied from the provided excerpts below. 

**Notes:**
*   Quotes like "our {mission} data" or "our new findings with {mission}" indicate a high "science" score.
*   Quotes like "Recent results from {mission}" or "Future {mission} observations" do not support a high "science" score and should not be included.
*   Quotes referencing other {mission} papers should not be considered - only focus on whether THIS paper presents new {mission} science.
*   Just because {mission} is frequently mentioned many times does not mean that this paper should be given a high "science" score.

**Scoring Guidelines:**
*   **0.0**: No mention of {mission} or only mentions future plans, proposals, simulations, or funding without presenting data/results from it within these excerpts.
*   **0.1-0.3**: Mentions {mission} or its instruments, maybe cites prior {mission} work, but the excerpts don't clearly show *new* analysis or results from {mission} in *this* paper. Could be purely motivational or comparative discussion.
*   **0.4-0.6**: Moderate indication that {mission} data/results are used, but the excerpts lack definitive statements of *new* findings derived from it. Cannot simply cite other {mission} papers.
*   **0.7-0.9**: Strong indication from the excerpts that *new* {mission} observations are presented or analyzed to derive new scientific results in this paper.
*   **1.0**: Excerpts explicitly state that new {mission} observations/data were obtained/analyzed for this work and new results are presented.

**JSON Output Format:**
{{
    "quotes": ["Exact quote 1 from excerpts...", "Exact quote 2..."],
    "science": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>,
    "reason": "Justification based ONLY on the excerpts."
